DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LINKEDLIST  AND ARRAYLISTS
1) LinkedList elements insertion is faster compared to ArrayLists
2) LinkedList element deletion is faster compared to ArrayLists
3) ArrayList search operations is pretty faster compared to the LinkedList search operation.
4) LinkedList doesn't provide random or index based access and you need to 
	iterate over linked list to retrieve any element
5) LinkedList has more memory overhead than ArrayList because in ArrayList each index only holds actual object
	but in case of linkedList each node holds both data and address of next and previous node
